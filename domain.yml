     Sure, let me check availability. How about scheduling your diagnostic centre appointment on the upcoming {day_name} {period_name}? 
     If that suits you, we can proceed with the booking.

     Excellent choice! Your diagnostic centre appointment is scheduled for next {day_name} {period_name} at 2:30PM. Thank you!

      I recommend checking with the diagnostic centre directly for the allocated slots for doctor&#39;s appointments, 
      as the availability may vary. They can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information on available
      time slots.
